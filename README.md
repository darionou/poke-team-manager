# Pokemon Team Manager

This is my implementation of a small app that allows users to create and manage Pokémon teams. The application is built with a React.js frontend and a Node.js backend using PostgreSQL for database management. Users can create teams, add Pokémon, view team details, and filter teams by Pokémon types.
